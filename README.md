# Mini Project 2


## Description

This project will be using Pandas dataframes. The goal here is to come up with some question and then see what
API or datasets you can use to get the information needed to answer that question. I had video game questions about
popular video games and found a Kaggle dataset to use and answered my questions within it adn through charts. 


## Getting Started

### Dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Executing program

```
python main.py
```

## Output

This will out put two png files into a charts folder from the Kaggle file found below. The two graphs should be 
Top 3 Teams By Popular Games, and Distribution of Ratings Among Popular Games.
